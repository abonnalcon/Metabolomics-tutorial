# Metabolomics-tutorial

<p align="justify">
This repository contains material for the metabolomics practical tutorial part of the **Medical Genomics** course to be held at the INSA Lyon engineering school (French National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon) in the Biosciences MSc curriculum during the Fall 2020 (https://biosciences.insa-lyon.fr/en/)

Here you will use interactive Jupyter Notebooks run in Binder to test an example of a metabolomics data analysis workflow. 

Here we present you 2 main Jupyter Notebooks, with one containing an exemple of data pre-processing and processing and one with a data analysis workflow:

* Notebook 1: Metabolomics data processing.

* Notebook 2: Metabolomics data analysis workflow


The data analysis tutorial is inspired and derived from the Jupyter Notebooks tutorial based on publication: "Toward Collaborative Open Data Science in Metabolomics using Jupyter Notebooks and Cloud Computing". `SI_Mendez_etal_2019`
