# Metabolomics-tutorial

<p align="justify">
This repository contains material for the metabolomics practical tutorial part of the **Medical Genomics** course to be held at the INSA Lyon engineering school (French National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon) in the Biosciences MSc curriculum during the Fall 2020 (https://biosciences.insa-lyon.fr/en/)

Here you will use interactive Jupyter Notebooks run in Binder to test an example of a metabolomics data analysis workflow. 

Here we present you a Jupyter Notebook containing a data analysis workflow:

* Notebook 1: Metabolomics data analysis workflow
You can access and run this interactive notebook online [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adam-amara/Metabolomics-tutorial/HEAD)

If you want to run this notebook on your local machine make sure to install Jupyter, Python, and the dependencies used for this tutorial (see Notebook Part 1 to find the libraries used)


The data analysis tutorial is inspired and derived from the Jupyter Notebooks tutorial based on publication: "Toward Collaborative Open Data Science in Metabolomics using Jupyter Notebooks and Cloud Computing". `SI_Mendez_etal_2019`
Available in Github: https://github.com/CIMCB/MetabWorkflowTutorial
